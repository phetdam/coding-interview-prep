coding-interview-prep
=====================

Simple [#]_ code often written, referenced, or used during technical interviews.

Contains simple implementations of fundamental data structures, algorithms,
fixes of buggy code, etc. usually found in questions asked during software
engineering, quant, or technical research position interviews.

Since some questions are language dependent (ex. C++ references are very
different from Python references), the first level of subdirectories splits the
source by language, with the subsequent level specifying topics.

.. [#] To be fair, the implementations here are an order of magnitude cleaner
   than what one would typically end up writing under pressure in an interview.
   Unless asked, you wouldn't worry about inheritance and perfect-looking code.
